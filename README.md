# CUSTOMER-BEHAVIOUR-ANALYSIS
Customer Behavior Dashboard (Python & Power BI)
This repository hosts a project designed to analyze and visualize customer behavior data using Python for data processing and Power BI for interactive dashboard creation. 
Overview
The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights into customer purchasing habits, demographics, and trends. By transforming raw transactional data into a visual dashboard, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and increase sales. 
Technologies Used
Python: Used for data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and generating processed datasets (likely .csv or direct database uploads).
Key Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (if segmentation is involved).
Power BI: Utilized for data modeling, creating interactive visualizations, and publishing the final dashboard.
SQL (Optional): May be used for initial data extraction or storage. 
Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories: 
data/: Contains raw input data files (e.g., raw_transactions.csv).
notebooks/: Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data processing notebooks (e.g., customer_eda.ipynb, data_preprocessing.ipynb).
src/: Contains any reusable Python scripts (e.g., clean_data.py).
powerbi/: Stores the Power BI project file (.pbix) and any related assets.
output/: The destination for processed data files used as input for the Power BI dashboard (e.g., processed_customer_data.csv).
documentation/: Any supporting documents or data dictionaries.
